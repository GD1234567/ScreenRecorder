# Monte Media Library
Project based on Monte Media Library

The Monte Media Library is a Java library for processing media data. Supported media formats include still images, video, audio and meta-data.

This library has some overlap in functionality with the **Java Media Framework (JMF)**. For some codecs, the [Monte Media Library!](http://www.randelshofer.ch/monte/) provides wrappers, which allow to use them with **JMF**. However, in general, Monte Media is not compatible with JMF.
